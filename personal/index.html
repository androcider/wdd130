           <p>One of the best ways to prepare is to have a safety kit in your vehicle. 
            Each kit should be tailored to the needs of your family but all have a basic list that should include:

            Once you assemble your supplies, you'll want to store them in sturdy container, 
            like a large vacuum-seal bag or a plastic storage bin. But don't just forget 
            about it. Experts say it's important to check and refresh supplies once or 
            twice a year, so they're in good condition for whatever the road throws your way.
