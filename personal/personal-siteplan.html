        Basic kit /Family kit
Have you ever been stuck on the side of the road with a flat tire or other car trouble? How long did it take for help to arrive? Do you have the supplies needed to survive if you are ever in this situation? Here is a basic list of items that you should have in your car to survive the ordeal. 
Spare tire
Jack and wheel wrench
Tool kit
Flares or safety triangle
Blankets
Mobile battery pack
Drinking water
Nonperishable food
Flashlight and batteries
First aid kit
First extinguisher
Medications
Toilet paper
Disinfecting wipes
Hand sanitizer
Feminine products
Ziplock bags 
Trash bags
When making a safety kit for the family additional items need to be added to it to accommodate the additional people. An individual kit for each family member can be made or just 1 large group kit. Some additional item may include:

If there is a baby traveling in the car usually the standard diaper bag is sufficient for the trip however make sure to have extra:
Formuala/baby food
Bottles
Diapers
Diaper cream
Wipes
Clothing

Once you assemble your supplies, you'll want to store them in sturdy container, like a large vacuum-seal bag or a plastic storage bin. But don't just forget about it. Experts say it's important to check and refresh supplies once or twice a year, so they're in good condition for whatever the road throws your way.

      </ul>
      <h3>Other Considerations</h3>
      <p>
        Other considerations
One of the unseen perils of a survival situation is the mental stress that comes from not knowing when you will be rescued and from the inevitable boredom that comes along with waiting for help. What ever keeps you occupied at home can be useful additions to your safety kit. Examples of this include:
Deck of cards
Books to read
Books to color
Crosswords
Notepad and pens 
Knitting
Crochet


By having something to do while you are waiting for help, you can keep your mind sharp and be able to keep the boredom to a minimum.
